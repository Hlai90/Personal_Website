						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>
							Hi, My name is <strong>Howard</strong> and I am
							excited to be in this program. I chose the<em>
								Computer Information Technology</em
							>
							as my program because I believe that there are many
							great job prospects in the future and I would like
							to learn more. I am mainly interested in
							cybersecurity since security has always been my long
							term goal. Learning languages such as
							<em>python</em>, and <em>javascript</em> are really
							enjoyable. I have a passion for programming and hope
							to continue on this journey My hobbies include
							things like video game, badminton, and programming!
						</p>
						<p>
							In my first term at BCIT, I learned a lot of things
							inside of my System Administrator class such as the
							hardware that makes up a computer and software that
							is used to manage the processes of each hardware. In
							my Web Develeopment class, I learned how to create
							my own website using various methods such as flex
							and grid to layout each section of my website.
