    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, My name is <strong>Howard</strong> and I am excited to be in this
      program. I chose the<em> Computer Information Technology</em> as my
      program because I believe that there are many great job prospects in the
      future and I would like to learn more. I am mainly interested in
      cybersecurity since security has always been my long term goal. Learning
      languages such as <em>python</em>, and <em>javascript</em> are really
      enjoyable. I have a passion for programming and hope to continue on this
      journey My hobbies include things like video game, badminton, and
      programming!
