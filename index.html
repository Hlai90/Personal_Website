      <p>
        Hi, My name is <strong>Howard</strong> and I am excited to be in this
        program. I chose the<em> Computer Information Technology</em> as my
        program because I believe that there are many great job prospects in the
        future and I would like to learn more. I am mainly interested in
        cybersecurity since security has always been my long term goal. Learning
        languages such as <em>python</em>, and <em>javascript</em> are really
        enjoyable. I have a passion for programming and hope to continue on this
        journey My hobbies include things like video game, badminton, and
        programming!
